MissingOutputException in rule get_inventory in file C:\Users\Tanner\drought_index\Snakefile, line 31:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/ghcnd-inventory.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
